Cory, I got a better idea. Just keep the set and I'll send you another Philadelphia quarter panel with all the coins to replace the one that's missing a coin. It'll actually cost me less and you don't have to waster your time with the Post Office. Steve
Do you know what 1.18 scale is as its for 1.18 diecast model cars didn't you read the title or the  discription . Where would you get a full size PETER  BROCK POSTER for $5. Next time read if you're not sure what 1.18 is send a message before you buy. Anyway I'm ringing ebay as I don't appreciate being called a scammer and a fraud. Might even go to the police as you're ain't allowed to call people that.

Hi Laura thanks for getting back to me, in your email when I ordered it said 26th would be the latest I would receive the items, so I did check this morning with my neighbours they received nothing, and I also went to my nearest sorting office in Wembley, sudbury they had nothing, please let me know what is happening. Thanks

Thanks  Sarah x   Dear Customer,  We are currently experiencing delays due to coronavirus. We are working hard to get replacements & exchanges out.

Dear Matthias,  Thanks for getting back to me. I do magic lantern performances (using 1915 era projectors refitted with LED lamps) and so I'm serious about potentially purchasing this, as it would be of great usefulness for the shows I do. But unfortunately, even 2450 is a little more than I can afford right now. If the time comes later this spring or summer when you might offer a greater discount -- more around 1700 Euro ($2000 US) -- then I would be able to do something. If you're still looking for someone to buy it later, and that seems like an acceptable price, then I do hope you will be in touch. In no rush for it, as bookings for magic lantern shows have been canceled or postponed until COVID-19 becomes less of a problem. Spending time now getting new material ready for future magic lantern performances, and a projector like this one would be ideal for this.  All the Best,  Joel
Hey there are these full?
Just received this and noticed a broken part on the board that your picture also shows on your auction but your description didn't mention it. Where you aware of this? Im just letting you know, it appears to me that this "might" be OK still but if it's not then we'll have to work something out.
Thank you for your message. Firstly I must apologize for such a poor service. That shirt absolutely should not have been posted out. I have had to transition the business home an dI am still working out all the processes involved.       I will get another shirt in the post to you asap. There is no need to send the other one back and you may do with it as you like. Sometimes a spare shirt is useful.    Your shirt should be with you in the next couple of days postal services willing.    Kind Regards  Andy
Sorry Iâd prefer to keep the set together

Hey, when I looked up the numbers and stuff online if the Xbox thatâs what it said from the information I collected from a couple different places to make sure. Also, when I listed the item thereâs an option where you can scan the barcode on the system. So thatâs what I did and it filled in the weight and other specifications and Iâm assuming that they filled that in as well. Because when I looked up the information online I went to fill in that item and it was already pre-filled in. I really do apologize about that. I had no idea whatsoever. I never really downloaded anything on the Xbox. I had discs for the games. The only game I downloaded
Ok np. They're selling for that in b&m right now.

Hi, since the virus, there have been delays to the post. I do know some items have taken two weeks to arrive, nothing yet longer. If urgent, I can send more out, if you would return the second of the packages to arrive. If you chose to wait, and they have not arrived within 2 weeks let me know and I will just send replacements in any case. Apologies for the inconvenience. Anthony    Out of interest I also received this message from a customer.  "please accept my sincere apologies for my impatience. We had no luck this morning either, but I did have a chat with our postman. He tells me our main sorting office in Southampton has a football field sized area covered by mobile cages of undelivered post, due to staff shortages and dramatic increase in postal deliveries. I will try to be patient and thanks again for your help in this matter."

Bob,  Thanks so much!  You're right, we've experienced eBay's glitches too.  I'll send you a link to the posting when it is listed.    Thanks again, Dennis
Hi.  I send a message time ago because Iâm waiting for the other  charm. Thank you for your attention.
Dear friend,  I'm Lydia of Tourbon. Thank you for your order362821970215, we have already shipped it to you, the tracking number is LX118906645CN.  Any need pls feel free to contact me:)  Best Regards. Lydia   "I have found that if you love life, life will love you back"
I already have. AND Iâve already sent the other one ( for 6Splus) back. Iâve even sent you the USPS tracking number along with a picture of the receipt dated 4/6/2020. U should have it by now. I did this because yâall told me to do this in previous emails via eBay messages. Look, just refund my money and Iâll reorder from someone else.
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, heute erhielt ich eineRechnung und Rechnungskorrektur fÃ¼r Artikel welche nicht meiner Bestellung entsprechen. Ich habe bestellt: 2x A060125 AVO Silikonentferner 2500ml mit RE AR2004736321. Nun haben Sie mir eine Rechnung erstellt fÃ¼r A009S AVO 6x Lackspray Klarlack Glanz 500ml mit RE AR2004736323 und eine Rechnungskorrektur RE GU20042881. Diese Ware habe ich nicht bestellt. Bitte prÃ¼fen und korrigieren Sie diesen Vorgang. Zum Ergebnis erwarte ich zeitnah eine RÃ¼ckinformation. Vielen Dank MfG S.KÃ¶hring

Hi, since the virus, there have been delays to the post. I do know some items have taken two weeks to arrive, nothing yet longer. If urgent, I can send more out, if you would return the second of the packages to arrive. If you chose to wait, and they have not arrived within 2 weeks let me know and I will just send replacements in any case. Apologies for the inconvenience. Anthony    Out of interest I also received this message from a customer.  "please accept my sincere apologies for my impatience. We had no luck this morning either, but I did have a chat with our postman. He tells me our main sorting office in Southampton has a football field sized area covered by mobile cages of undelivered post, due to staff shortages and dramatic increase in postal deliveries. I will try to be patient and thanks again for your help in this matter."
Can you please send me an invoice for the two bottles plus the combined shipping.  Thank you
I have not recieved the item

hard to tell from the somewhat blurry picture, is that a silk screen printed label and not the newer Stone bottles sticker imitating a painted label?

I've been trying to tell you that it did not have this damage when I packed it and shipped it!  Look at my original photos- that's exactly how it was when I shipped it. Someone - probably customs- clearly opened and handled it roughly.  It was EXACTLY as listed when it left my house.   I got confirmation from eBay that they got my message but they haven't actually given me any info yet.   Obviously if the figure was not facing the same direction as it was in my listing photos, someone opened it and took it out.  Why would I do that???   I value my reputation and have never misrepresented an item.   I want to work this out so that we are both satisfied with the result.  If I had been able to insure this for the international shipment I would make a claim- but I couldn't- that's not how their international shipping works. I've asked you several times if you insured for the full price but you have not answered.
What year model is this? And what OS is it running?
I will have a free bottle sent. Thank you
We have finally received the parcel from the first order today! but unfortunetly is missing the red and purple beads! I hope the second parcel hasn't got the same missing otherwise we won't be able to make any. My little girl who may i remind you is 5 years old is raising funds for nhs workers and currently has donations of Â£190. Companies have donated peg boards and card to make cards with hama beads rainbows. how can she proceed to make them if we haven't got the correct colours. I've message numerous times and the communication is terrible. I either need these sent out again to fulfil the order or I'll need a refund so we can purchase from somewhere else
hi friend   we wil send it soon pls do not worry about it hope you can get it earlier if you have anything trouble pls contact us  best regards Polly

Alas, the paint pens still not offered at the Urban Achievers store although the paint on a jar is.    Might be a worthwhile âNEW ITEMâ to try out this spring.  The paint pen is incredibly useful for to draw atttention to calibration marking on equipment, leave set-point notes/specs,  even polarity marks or mark cables  to match or where to plug on the back of a panel for frequent set up/take down.    Easiest to use by just shaking to mix, then take off cap.  True this is not about lures, but definitely essential to other activities.    FYI.....
Hiermit mÃ¶chte ich den Kauf abbrechen...  MFG

cortesemene mi dice la data di acquisto ? non riesco a trovare l acquisto . grazie. o fatto il pagamento il 17-04-2020 dopo vostra richiesta da paypal, di euro 200 come accordo.  Â 
Thanks. I ended up buying it for $25 more when it was relisted as item number 264709893325. But something seemed not quite right about the shipping charge: The PayPal invoice listed $100 for shipping, so I reluctantly ended up sending you $50 more than I thought I'd be paying for shipping. Would appreciate it if you could remedy this. Thanks. Best, Joel

Okay. For Puerto Rico it may be more then $60, but I will leave it at that. I will also meet you at $110. Thats the least I can do. Thanks!
When you're ready to purchase if you do end up paying for all postage I can give you extra ones or I can refund the extra postage.  As I also don't know how to send invoice but other people sent me invoices to combine postage so I don't know how they done it. Also if there's any Brock posters or Banners that you like that I don't have I can see if I can make it for you. Or fine the picture.  Thanks again  Regards Aaron
That's fine, if it turns up after you get another chain let me know and I will give you the return postage and full refund.
Thank you. And do those have prices on it?  Regard, Dave

Hallo Jennifer. I really wasn't paying attention!  Just noticed that you are bidding on upcoming badges and for the sake of combined postage, please allow me to invoice you after the listings have finished.   Alternatively, you can request an invoice at your convenience, that would make a lot more sense!  In the meanwhile, take care.  Gerry.

Hi Dave,  Thanks very much for your patience with us. I've now gone in and revised the shipping costs on the second shirt you're interested in. This should bring the total postage for the 2 shirt parcel down to 11.50$.... I'm really hoping this fixes the issue on our end.   Yep! We would definitely prefer to be on the road... that said, we do certainly appreciate your support during this covid non.touring season.  Please do let me know if this continues to be a pain and we'll figure it out some other way.  Thanks again!  all the best,  Slackers.

Actually as I said in all my earlier email, I MOVED. That was the reason I bought those exact light from your company, because you promised, no your guaranteed delivery by the 24th. You failed at you end, which if you had actually mailed it in a timely manner and not waited 4 days, it would have been to my home. As I said I am headed cross county to live in Iowa so you can now cancel my order and refund my money as they are not of use to me now as my mechanic did not move with me.

Hello, they clearly are not coming to collect the box, it has been sat by my front door for ages now and they have stopped sending messages with times they will arrive. Please can you contact them as I have been left in the dark and have a box sat at my front door just waiting for a collection that isnt happening. Thank you.
Iâm not sure. Iâll see what I can find out and get back to you. Are you located in Sevierville or Pigeon Forge?
Im sure you would.   The thing is I basically switched up 2 european orders.  Another person has your 5 45s.  So I'm going to send the other person the $ via paypal so they can ship the 45s to you.  I will do this today.   Then when the Double LP shows up in Austria if I could do the same things with you.  I'll send you the $ for the shipping from you to the other person.     With all that is going on with the pandemic, its hard for me to ship things to Europe.  Its easier if I can just swap out the merch.   Sound ok?   thanks  Dave
OK,we will confirm with the paypal where is wrong and solve the problem for you as soon as possible Best regards Beyal

Dear Bea,   Thank you for letting me know that you would like to return the headset, which is totally fine.   However, the reason for returning shouldn't be "Doesn't work or is defective", it should be "Change of mind" or "Order by mistake" etc.   I understand the headset doesn't connect to your device but this is not a fault of the product. As stated in the item title and the listing description, this is a QD Connect headset which I also included a picture of the connector in picture 3.  I am not sure if there is a way for you to change the return reason now, and if that's possible I would appreciate it if you could do so. If that isn't possible then, please could you cancel this return request and I will provide you with the return details separately. As soon as the item is returned I will issue a refund of Â£22.50 back to you (after deducting the extra Â£6.50 for the 1 Day courier charge on your request).  I hope that you would understand and agree with what I have suggested above.   Please do kindly let me know if it's possible to change the returning reason, or if you have any other queries. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Kind regards, Jen

Ciao,visto che parli solo su ebay mi dica cosa fare,visto che hai parlato con ebay come procediamo?   Ti mando il corriere e poi ti faccio nuova spedizione ?
Hi again. Out of curiosity, would you perhaps be interested in trading this against a new 12TB Western Digital Red hard drive? No worries if you are not interested but I thought I would just ask. Regards.
Instead of refund could you send one like this for apple iPhone Model #A1522 white preferred, but any will do. If this is too confusing just refund to PayPal and Iâll just reorder for the A1522. The A1522 you sent as my second order fit but the glass already cracked.
Sent thanks
Hi , that would be fine ,  but delivery would be between 6.30-7 am. Please make an offer and I'll accept it.  Kind regards  Thomas

Hi Daniel,  I have bought the bonnet, door and boot lid, I'll pay Â£25 cash on Collection. I will collect Wednesday if you think it will be safe to leave out for me, and won't be taken before I get there. Mismatch trim would still be great definitely the steal bar though and any spares would be fantastic. I appreciate your time and service of this transaction and look forward to picking up the parts tomorrow!  Kindest Regards George Reed

Hi,  I hope youâre enjoying your new iPhone.   Feedback on eBay is crucial to selling and buying reputation and assurance. So can I please ask that you leave me some feedback and Iâll do the same for you, itâll be much appreciated.  Thanks, Andy
Hi how much for this item to be sent 1st class
Hallo, Habe die Modelle schon bezahlt, bitte mit den versenden noch warten, vielleicht habe ich ja noch bei den Ford Modellen glÃ¼ck, danke! GruÃ  Thorsten
Hi.  I'm afraid I need to retract this bid, something I've never done in my 20 year history with ebay.  When you declined my initial offer, I made a second offer before reading your comment underneath stating your company was not able to accept ANY discount on this item.  Once I read that, I knew my second offer would also be declined and therefore purchased the Kolton table lamps elsewhere. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause your company and appreciate your help with canceling this offer.  Thank you for your help, Linda Stephens

Dear  Heidi, Today we have shipped your order by boat due to not being able to deliver by airplan. Its tracking number is RO140202825TH. It is about 2 months to The United States. Once your item arrives in satisfactory condition, please leave positive feedback for us. We try to give the best service to you. Thank you for your shopping with us. Hope to deal with you again. Have a nice day. Sincerely Yours, Namjit
hello friend,thanks for your reply, the order has been canceled, please check your refund later sorry for all the trouble please take care of yourself during the virus time best regards Clara
Here's some information you should be aware of:  This item will ship in a large (18-wheeler or box-style) truck, so delivery is easiest for you when shipped to a business address such as your workplace or local mechanic. If delivered to your residence, extra fees may apply. Our carriers will NOT deliver to apartments under any circumstances. Commercial freight carriers will NOT drop-off items. At least two people will be required to be present to unload.  I cannot guarantee that the driver will call ahead, so residential delivery is easiest for you when enough people to unload the item are home between the hours of 8-5, Mon-Fri.  If you can handle these restrictions, then there is potential to make that work. Just let us know what you would like to do!    How would you rate my reply? Great Â Â  Okay Â Â  Not Good  -- Thanks  On Mon, Apr 27, 2020 at 4:32 PM EDT, Ebay - Jblax636 <> wrote:

Hi..im waiting on a second contact from rm..as the online reply to me was that the item has been delivered..i know that because of the covid.19 all signed for items are being posted thru the door with no signature request ..this is true as the other 4 lots i sent out were all received at the end of last week yet on the tracking they all still say delivery in progress..i too had to wait 10 days for a special delivery which was left on my doorstep..i have now requested proof of delivery or where it is as they should take a photo of the door it was posted thru if ofcourse it was delivered or still on its way...i know how frustrating this is and though not my fault can only once again apologise for such an inconvenience ..rgds
Was I one short, or did you just not have enough in your order?

Hey good day I already paid for this item I was wondering when youâll be able to ship it out thank you and please respond
U r so kind.  I will be in touch as soon as it gets here.  Due to covid 19 Dad will be cremated and we aren't having a life celebration until restrictions are lifted.  If I went home now I would have to quarantine in New York state for 14 days and then quarantine again in Canada for 14 days. There's just no sense to rush. I am high risk anyway and both my family and my doctor advised that I do not travel now. Talk to you soon
Hey! No worries! I will update the label. I will ship it out tomorrow :)  Kenny
I would like to know if you could ship it to Japan, thanks.
Okay, we should be all set. I just modified this Recchi listing to a lot for the 4 quad diamonds, You should be able to click the buy it now and be all set. I only had pics saved of the three cards but it is for all 4 as we made the deal for.    Thnaks! ~Rick

Bonjour,  Nous rÃ©ussirons Ã  nous comprendre ?!  Certainement que j'ai Ã©tÃ© trop rapide pour lire lors de l'achat du chÃ¢le, mais je n'ai pas vu le moyen de rÃ©gler. Et je me disais que c'Ã©tait un coup d'Ã©pÃ©e dans l'eau ! Je ne m'attendais plus a avoir de vos nouvelles.  Puis vous rÃ©apparaissez en me disant que je n'ai pas payer. Maintenant il me reste les frais d'envoi. Bien sÃ»r qu'il me parait logique de payer des frais d'envoi.  Mais sur le site d'achat, rien n'est vraiment clair pour tout cela.  Ce matin je vous demandais de me redonner votre RIB pour pouvoir vous envoyer 5 â¬. Je n'ai plus la rÃ©fÃ©rence de votre banque.  DÃ¨s que vous me l'envoyez, je vous paie, pas de problÃ¨me.  Cordialement  Marie
Are you going to help with this or do I need to get ebay involved?  I responded back to your request about the issue, but you are not responding.  What are we doing about the item?  It is damaged and wasnt packaged properly.

Hi yes I post yesterday afternoon.
Really? Iâve never heard of that happening before? So are they returning it to me? This whole thing is confusing to me. It makes no sense to my why it took so long. I sold something else a couple days after I shipped your item. And shipped this other item like 3-4 days after I shipped yours and that was delivered yesterday. So is the item apparently being shipped back to me? Have you tried calling usps and telling them that you want this package. And told them itâs something you ordered on eBay? I mean if they need to speak to me just let me know.
XL
That's fine.
Okay, dann sollte es ja eine win/win Situation fÃ¼r beide sein, du hast gutes Geld bekommen und ich kann endlich Manager wieder zocken :-D  Hast es heute zur Post gebracht ?
Ok, kindly cancel the sale, I thought it was a good dinner set.
Hi would you consider posting this please if I paid for the postage?

Sorry! We advertise these as new in box.  If I take them out of the box and unwrap them, then I could not sell them like that.  We received these by the case and have not opened any of them individually.  Thanks!
Ich brauche bitte eine Rechnung. MfG Aydin
Sorry I met the character maximum for the last message. But if they do need to contact me, just let me know. And let me know whoever I need to contact. I honestly have no idea wth is going on with this. It to me sounds like usps is not doing something they should be doing. But like I said I would just contact the usps office in maybe the town that the package is in or if they donât have an office in that town call the closest one. I mean I donât understand why they are shipping it back because you missed the delivery of the item one time.

Hey! I had to create another label, I wanted to ship in a larger medium flat rate postal box so it ships better! Thatâs why I created a new label. I want to make sure it gets to you in excellent condition. And no. The original âhandlingâ time I set was late May because I wasnât sure when Funko would ship orders. But the funko is going out today and you should receive updated info. Iâd say it will get to you before the end of the week.  Kenny
